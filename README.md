## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Fork this Repository 🍴

Click the **Fork** button at the top-right corner of this page.  
This will create a copy of this repository under your GitHub account.


### 2. Clone Your Fork 📥

Now clone the forked repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/first-pr-repo.git
```
```bash
cd first-pr-repo
```

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!


### 3. Create a New Branch 🌿

Use the following command to create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b my-first-contribution
```

This creates a new branch called `my-first-contribution` and switches to it automatically.

### 4. Make Your Change ✍️

Open the `index.html` file in a code editor of your choice and add your name in the following format:

```markdown
<li>
  Your name - I am from ___ !
</li>
```

Save the file after making your changes.

### 5. Add and Commit Your Change 💾

After making your changes, run the following commands:

```bash
git add .
```

```bash
git commit -m "Add my name to the contributors list"
```

The first command stages your changes, and the second command creates a commit with your changes and a descriptive message.

### 6. Push to GitHub 🚀

Push your branch using:

```bash
git push origin my-first-contribution
```

This sends your new branch with the committed changes to your fork on GitHub.

### 7. Create a Pull Request 🛎️

1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub
2. Click on the **Compare & pull request** button that appears at the top
3. Add a title and description to your PR
4. Click **Create pull request**
